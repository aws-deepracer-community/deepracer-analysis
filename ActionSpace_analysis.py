# # Action Space analysis for AWS DeepRacer
# This notebook has been built for the [AWS DeepRacer-Analysis](https://github.com/aws-deepracer-community/deepracer-analysis.git) 
# provided by  the [AWS DeepRacer Community](http://join.deepracing.io).
#
# ## Usage
# Copy this Notebook to "work" folder in your allready installed [AWS DeepRacer-Analysis](https://github.com/aws-deepracer-community/deepracer-analysis.git)
#
# **This notebook isn't complete.**
# If you find some bugs, have problems with some tracks or something else
# please report to @Kire in [AWS Machine Learning Community](https://aws-ml-community.slack.com) on #Slack

# Let's get to it.
#
# ## Imports
#
# Run the imports block below:

# + tags=[]
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# %matplotlib inline

from deepracer.tracks import TrackIO, Track
from deepracer.logs import \

# ## Load waypoints for the track you want to run analysis on
#
# Remeber that evaluation npy files are a community effort to visualise the tracks in the trainings, they aren't 100% accurate.
#
# Tracks Available:

# + tags=[]
tu = TrackIO()

for f in tu.get_tracks():
    print(f)
# -

# Take the name from results above and paste below to load the key elements of the track and view the outline of it.

l_track = track.center_line
l_outer_border = track.outer_border
l_inner_border = track.inner_border

pu.plot_trackpoints(track)
# -

# ## Get the logs
#
# Depending on which way you are training your model, you will need a different way to load the data.
#
# **AWS DeepRacer Console**
# The logs are being stored in CloudWatch, in group `/aws/robomaker/SimulationJobs`. You will be using boto3 to download them based on the training ID (stream name prefix). If you wish to bulk export the logs from Amazon Cloudwatch to Amazon S3 :: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/S3ExportTasks.html
#
# **DeepRacer for Dummies/ARCC local training**
# Those two setups come with a container that runs Jupyter Notebook (as you noticed if you're using one of them and reading this text). Logs are stored in `/logs/` and you just need to point at the latest file to see the current training. The logs are split for long running training if they exceed 500 MB. The log loading method has been extended to support that.
#
# **Chris Rhodes' repo**
# Chris repo doesn't come with logs storage out of the box. I would normally run `docker logs dr > /path/to/logfile` and then load the file.
#
# Below I have prepared a section for each case. In each case you can analyse the logs as the training is being run, just in case of the Console you may need to force downloading of the logs as the `cw.download_log` method has a protection against needless downloads.
#
# Select your preferred way to get the logs below and you can get rid of the rest.

# + tags=[]
# AWS DeepRacer Console
fname = 'logs/sample-console-logs/logs/training/training-20220611230353-EHNgTNY2T9-77qXhqjBi6A-robomaker.log'
# -

# ## Load the trace training log
#
# Now that the data is downloaded, we need to load it into memory. We will first read it from file and then convert to data frames in Pandas. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library for handling and analysing large amounts of data series. Remember this name, you may want to learn more about how to use it to get more information that you would like to get from the logs. Examples below are hardly scratching the surface.
#
# One important information to enter is the setting of your Episodes per iteration hyperparameter. This is used to group the episodes into iterations. This information is valuable when later looking at graphs showing how the training progresses per iteration. You can use it to detect which iteration gave you better outcomes and, if in local training, you could move to that iteration's outcome for submissions in the AWS DeepRacer League or  for continuing the training.
#
# The log files you have just gathered above have lines like this one:
# ```
# SIM_TRACE_LOG:799,111,1.7594,4.4353,3.0875,-0.26,2.50,2,1.0000,False,True,71.5802,49,17.67,1555554451.1110387
# ```
# This is all that matters for us. The first two are some tests I believe and when loading they get skipped, then each next line has the following fields:
# * episode number
# * step number
# * x coordinate
# * y coordinate
# * yaw of the car (where the car is heading)
# * decision about turning (turn value from your action space)
# * decision about throttle (speed value from your action space)
# * decision index (value from your action space)
# * reward value
# * is the car going backwards
# * are all wheels on track?
# * progress in the lap
# * closest waypoint
# * track length
# * timestamp
#
# `la.load_data` and then `la.convert_to_pandas` read it and prepare for your usage. Sorting the values may not be needed, but I have experienced under some circumstances that the log lines were not ordered properly.
